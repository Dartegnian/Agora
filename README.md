We were the representatives of <a href="https://apc.edu.ph" target="_blank">Asia Pacific College</a> for the inter-collegiate Tamahack competition during FEU Tech's Technofest 2017. Our objective was to develop a project that can make the general public more interested in the Philippine government, and promote transparency within it. Thus, we decided to come up with a concept that shows the current government projects within your area and nearby areasâ€”with a full breakdown of the costs associated with it. This project is supposed to show you the entire breakdown of the budget, some pictures of the project, the estimated development time, the congressman/woman in charge of it, the congressman/woman's contact information, and much more. Due to time constraints, and with the mishap that occurred during the event, we were not able to implement some of these proposed features. The development status of this project is currently **DELAYED** (see note below).

## Usage
The files herein are supposed to be hosted locally, which means that links point to **http://localhost/TAMAHACK**, so, at all costs, **please do not rename the folder** in order to maintain compatibility. Again, please take note that this project is a working prototype, so understand that there **will** be bugs/incomplete features in this app. We planned to integrate Google Maps within this project but due to various problems (spotty Internet connection, time constaints, etc.), we were unable to do so.

## Developer Notes
I have moved **all** of the files used by the project to `Version 1` because I plan to redesign and, basically, refresh Agora on my free time this summer. I'm looking forward to applying all of the things I've learned over the course of the summer to this project. The main motivation for me to *refresh* this project was the fact that this project made us win the competition. I only see fit for this project to be constantly updated. With that reasoning, I've decided to upgrade this project. I promise to streamline the experience of Agora as much as possible. Thank you for following the progress of this project and I hope you find it enjoyable or interesting.
