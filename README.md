We were the representatives of Asia Pacific College for the inter-collegiate Tamahack competition during FEU Tech's Technofest. Our objective was to develop a solution that can make the general public more interested in the Philippine government and to promote transparency within it. Thus, we decided to come up with a concept that shows the current government projects within your areaâ€”with a full breakdown of the info associated with it. This project is supposed to show you the entire breakdown of the budget, some pictures of the project, the estimated development time, the congressman/woman in charge of it, and much more. Due to time constraints, and with the mishap that occurred, we were not able to implement some of these proposed features. The development status of this project is currently **CANCELLED OR DELAYED** as the developers are currently busy with other things.

## Usage
The files herein are supposed to be hosted locally, which means that links point to **http://localhost/TAMAHACK**, so, at all costs, **please do not rename the folder** in order to maintain compatibility. Again, please take note that this project is a working prototype, so understand that there **will** be bugs/incomplete features in this app. We planned to integrate Google Maps within this project but due to problems (spotty Internet connection, time constaints, etc.), we were unable to do so.
